Do not forget to do the following to center the webpage. 

Put this one line of code just after the 
<body> tag in the html file so that it looks like

<body>
  <div id="container" style="margin: 0 auto; width: xxxpx; text-align: left;>
    ...entire layout goes here...
  </div>
</body>

In the width part, just use some number like 800 or 1200 etc instead of the "xxx".
