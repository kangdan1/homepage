<p> Please visit this page as often as you please as new opportunities may arise for some of you interested in this area.

<p> There are theoretical as well computational projects in the area of gas dynamics that I am currently interested in and you are welcome to inquire about these.
In the eighties, I have worked on problems arising in gas dynamics. In particular, direct and inverse problems in aerodynamics for the purpose of design of airfoil in subcritical compressible flows were solved by developing and computer implementations of new techniques to solve these problems efficiently. For this purpose partial differential equations governing compressible flow equations in real and complex planes were solved. I have been interested in compressible
gas dynamics in the context of Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability and current work is in progress in this area. I did do considerable work in this area in the eighties (unpublished). If you are interested to work in this area, please contact me. For my past work of the eighties, please browse the publications posted at the following link.
