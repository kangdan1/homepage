We have currently several very active projects in this area. One graduate student (Zhiying Hai) has been working in this area
as part of his Ph.D. dissertation. I am looking for some more students and postdocs in this area. 
<br><br>

We have done considerable work on the linear stability of viscoelastic flows in Hele-Shaw cell and presented our results in APS/DFD
meetings, conferences and SIAM meetings since 2012. Currently we are developing appropriate models for porous media flows for chemical 
enhanced oil recovery by taking into account viscoelastic and shear-thinning effects of various chemicals used in such flooding 
process. There are not only modeling issues but fundamental mathematical issues with these models. More will be added here as 
research progresses in this direction.
