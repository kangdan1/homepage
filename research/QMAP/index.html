In solving many (NOT all) problems of classical physics, one essentially performs quasiconformal maps. Thus developing fast algorithms
for generating quasiconformal maps is a fundamental problem. It is useful not only for solving applied problems but also for pure mathematics such as computing Teichmuller maps. To see
this scope of Qmaps, Click <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=15090643586982869634&as_sdt=5,44&sciodt=0,44&hl=en" TARGET=QMAP">here</a>

We have developed necessary tools for generating quasiconformal maps in an efficient manner and very few poublications by us on this can be found through 
the following link. The algorithms that you find in the papers in this link need further refinement and improvement as well as need to be applied to a
wide variety of interesting problems.
