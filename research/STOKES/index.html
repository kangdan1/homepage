We have done theoretical and computational studies of creeping flows. In collaboration with D. Palaniappan, we have theoretically studied creeping flows of various types including planar and axisymmetric flows, interior/exterior flows with or without stick-slip boundary conditions, flows past hybrid (vapor-liquid, vapor-vapor, vapor-solid etc.) droplet, and flows past vapor-liquid compound droplet of two-sphere geometry in extensional and paraboloidal flows and so on. We have also generalized the circle and sphere theorems of classical hydrodynamics for a composite double body composed of two overlapping circles/spheres of arbitrary radii intersecting at a vertex angle pi/n,n an integer. The Kelvin transformation is used successively to obtain closed form expressions for several flow problems. The solutions for several flows in the presence of the composite geometry are derived by the use of these theorems. These solutions are in singularity forms, and the image singularities are interpreted in each case. In the case of three dimensional axisymmetric viscous flows, a Faxen relation for the force acting on the composite bubble is derived. In recent collaboration with Aditi Ghosh, we have developed fast algorithms for solving Stokes flow problems inside a cylinder. There are open computational projects in the application of these fast algorithms to solving some of the Stokes flow problems discussed above. Details on these can be found in the publications through the following link.
