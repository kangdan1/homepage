<B>Moving interface problems</B>

<P>
Numerical techniques of various kinds have emerged over last two decades for faithful computation 
of solutions of problems involving motion of interfaces in two- and three-dimensions.
These techniques have extended the range of problems that can be numerically solved in a variety 
of applied fields including fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, bio-medical engineering, material 
science and so on. The challenge now and in the years ahead is on manipulating properties of moving 
interfaces and their surroundings in ways to achieve some desired objectives. The motivation comes 
from realization that such manipulation can dramatically change the properties of the system. The
goal is then to develop multi-interface systems with potentially superior properties. We have been
active in this kind of research for a while with current focus on 1) Hele-Shaw type flows and
2) porous media flows. These problems provide the scope of studying various types of eigenvalue
problems whose studies require attention of researchers. They also provide an opportunity to
do research in the area of nonlinear stability analysis of system of nonlinear PDEs. Ongoing research 
in this area also involves simulation of multi-interface flows to gain statistical understanding on 
mutual interaction of various interfaces and their interaction with their surroundings. Most of 
these problems are open problems Preprints #46, #48, #51, #52, #53 are helpful in introducing some 
aspects of this topic.

<B>Multi-component multiphase flows in porous media</B>

<P>
Several ongoing projects currently focus on various aspects of porous media flow in the
context of oil recovery. Addition of various species in the displacing fluid and various
flooding strategies have been extensively utilized in order to improve oil recovery.
Despite considerable progress, challenges with capillary forces and fingering have prevented
such flooding processes from realizing their full potential. To improve oil recovery beyond
current level, a better understanding of the dependence of oil recovery on various 
properties of species in the displacing is required at a reasonable cost. Our current
focus of several projects is about an assessment of the dependence of displacement efficiency 
on a variety of flooding strategy as well as for a variety of components embedded in the 
displacing fluid at a reasonable cost. Mathematical equations modeling this improved
oil recovery process involve several field equations (system of nonlinear PDEs involving 
equations such as Darcy's law, continuity equations, Buckley Leverett equation, etc.) coupled 
with interfacial transport equations in the presence of heterogeneity, capillary forces, and 
some other effects. Theoretical and numerical analyses of these equations followed by numerically 
solving this multiscale problem are current focus of these projects. Some of the references are
articles #4, #41, #57, #61, #63.

<B>Analysis based fast algorithms in the real plane</B> 

<P>
Fast algorithms of various kinds have changed the landscape of computational science by providing an 
unprecedented opportunity to solve many large scale problems in reasonable time at levels of details 
and accuracy that were hitherto impossible. Because such algorithms attract considerable attention, 
there is considerable interest worldwide in reducing computational complexity of various computational 
processes. Any fast algorithm for a computational intensive problem of significant interest can have 
world wide impact. Our group has been active in this area and has contributed significantly to 
these efforts, particularly in Green's function representation of solutions of PDEs. The kernel of the 
integral in these representations is singular because of the Green's function. Traditional approaches 
to numerically evaluating these singular integrals are expensive and not so accurate. An analysis based 
fast algorithm in a disk for evaluation of such integrals was developed and tested on canonical problems 
by Borges and Daripa (see the article #27). This algorithm is very simple and direct. Hence it is easy 
to use. It is also very robust because it is not fragile, stability is not an issue, very accurate, and 
computational complexity is O(ln N) per node.  Moreover, the constant hidden behind the order 
O(ln N) is so small that in practice the complexity is O(1). The algorithm is inherently parallelizable 
by construction and easy to use on parallel machines as well. Please see the article #27 for details. 
Such fast algorithms for regular regions can be used in combination with domain embedding to solve 
efficiently these equations in complicated domains (see articles #29, #38 and #40). 
Several ongoing projects focus on development and applications of analysis based fast algorithms with 
some ingenuity for a variety of constant and non-constant coefficient PDEs in two and three-dimensions 
with added emphasis on understanding ways to reduce the value of the constant hidden in O(ln N) even 
further. Even developing one such algorithm or reducing the value of the constant will have great impact 
on sciences and engineering. There are other ongoing projects on the development of a variety of reliable, 
fast algorithms for other applications as well. This represents a great opportunity for students interested 
in doing research on numerical analysis and computational science.

There is scope of doing research under my guidance in the area of applied complex analysis and fast 
algorithms involving singular integrals in complex plane and their applications to a variety of problems
including quasiconformal mappings, scattering theory and inverse problems. Some of my previous works in 
this area are articles # 11, 13, 19, and 20.

There are several projects in the area of illposed and inverse problems. Most of these
problems that are of current focus arise in the context of fluid mechanics, though no
knowledge of fluid mechanics is required as these are cast as problems involving PDEs.
There are some open problems in this area.

numerically and theoretically. We are looking for a graduate student to work on this project.

<B>Energy Resources Area (Enhanced Oil Recovery by ASP Flooding)</B>

<P>
There is scope of doing applied and/or fundameantal and/or computational and/or mathematical modeling 
research in this area. There is already a group of graduate students and postdocs engaged in various 
aspects of this project. I am looking for more to join in this as well as in several other new areas of 
energy resource. Below is a brief background on the significance of this research. Read the last paragraph
as well.
<br>
<br>

There is no denying the fact that there is a rising energy demand
world wide in a market of tight supply. To alleviate this situation,
there is going to be much needed research in energy resources area
in the foreseeable future. One such area is oil recovery. After
conventional (primary and secondary) oil recovery methods are
exhausted, it is estimated that total residual oil in these reservoirs
around the world is around 70% of the original oil in place (OOIP).
This oil is retained due to capillary forces (usually after water
flood in light oil reservoirs). Also oils that are less mobile or
almost immobile due to high viscosity (of heavy oils and tar sands)
are in a sense trapped. EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) methods are
designed to reduce capillary forces and increase effective mobility
of oils, thereby lowering the residual oil saturation and hence improving
oil recovery. There are many EOR methods which can be broadly classified
into three categories: (i) thermal methods; (ii) miscible methods and 
(iii) chemical methods. These methods differ in ways the reduction of 
capillary forces and enhancement of effective mobility of oil are attempted. 
These variety of methods are needed because reservoir formation and fluid 
properties determine the suitability of an EOR method for a particular 
reservoir. However, an EOR method which may be suitable for a reservoir 
from these considerations may not be economically viable for all countries
at certain point in time due to excessive labor and other costs in
certain countries. Ultimately, the choice of an EOR method depends
on many considerations, economical as well as technological.
<br>
<br>

The percentage of OOIP retained by a reservoir after conventional
flooding (if the reservoir offers favorable conditions for such
flooding) depends on the type of formation. For example, conventional
recovery methods work very well to recover almost 50% of OOIP for
light oil leaving the rest 50% as a target of EOR. This target of EOR
rises to almost 90% for heavy oil and almost 100% for tar sand. This
stresses the much needed research in EOR since bulk of the OOIP is the
target of EOR but only a fraction of it is recovered by currently
successful EOR methods. Among thermal methods, steam based methods have
been more successful commercially than others. Among non-thermal methods,
miscible flooding has been remarkably successful. However, applicability of
these methods is limited by the availability and cost of solvents on
a commercial scale. Among immiscible gas injection methods, CO_2 (Carbon
Dioxide) floods have been relatively more successful than others for
heavy oils. Chemical methods have generally been uneconomic in the past,
but they hold promise for the future.
<br>
<br>

One of my current research areas deals with various aspects (fundamental
fluid dynamics issues, mathematical modeling, mathematical analysis of the
PDE system modeling this process, Hydrodynamic stability, simulation and
large scale optimization) of an EOR method by chemical flooding, namely
ASP-flooding project. This project is a perfect blend of fluid mechanics,
mathematics, chemistry, thermodynamics, numerical nanalysis, scientific
computing and applied analysis. ASP-flooding utilizes, as the name suggests,
mainly three chemicals: alkali, surfactant and polymer solutions. Surfactants
are effective in lowering the interfacial tension between oil and water to a
level that promotes mobilization of trapped oil drops. The alkaline agents
react with the acid components of crude oil and generate in situ surfactant
which overcomes the surfactant depletion in the liquid phases due to retention
by the rock matrix. These three chemicals together facilitate reduction of
interfacial surface tension and improvement of mobility ratio. Field tests
are encouraging (recoveries are 25%-30%) but at this recovery rate, economics
are marginal at best. Investment in the basic research of this EOR method by
ASP-flooding (Polymer flooding is a special case of ASP-flooding) will ensure
that this method has an important place in oil production for a long time
to come.
