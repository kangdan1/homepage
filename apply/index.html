<h2><a name="Students">For Prospective Students</a></h2>
<br><br>

<b>I am always looking for postdoctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students interested in working with me. Please feel free to contact me at daripa@tamu.edu or visit me in Blocker 629D. </b>
<br><br>

<li>For graduate students, click the "Research" tab in the header of this page for my research areas. Specific projects will depend on the student's background and interest. We will discuss one to one once you so indicate. Research funding is available (immediately as of 09/15/2022) which is described below.<br><br>
I can support as an RA during Spring 2023 one or two students from now until the end of May and may be longer. Depending on the outcome of this support during the Spring semester, I will have to provide a progress report to the funding agency in the beginning of summer for renewal of this funding. So, please know that this support should not be viewed as free money. The research topics are varied which I can discuss one-to-one. The specific research problems you will be looking into will be in an area of your interest with my consultation or in one of the following areas: 
(i) theory and computation in  incompressible/compressible flows, viscoelastic flows and/or liquid crystal (new); 
(ii) modeling, simulation and numerical analysis in porous media flows arising in chemical enhanced oil recovery; may involve machine learning tools.
(iii) analysis and computation using finite difference schemes for dispersive nonlinear waves and singularity formation; 
(iv) development, analysis and applications of Green's function based fast algorithms for elliptic and higher order PDEs; 
(v)  conservation laws, shock waves, riemann problems ...
(vi) Climate modeling

It is expected that you will continue research you initiate on the topic after the semester is over. 
During the spring we will meet on weekly basis. You can come and talk to me asap if you want to be an RA with me which will release you from TA duties at least for the spring. In most of the topics above (except the ones mentioned specifically), there is some past research published which you can find in my publications page (go to my homepage and click on the Publications tab) and (somewhat outdated) Research tab, but it is not necessary to do this at this point perhaps. Thank you.

<li> For undergraduate students, I have funding to support some students starting NOW (immediately as of 09/15/2022) through the next summer and possibly beyond on projects you propose and I approve, or projects I propose in any one of the following areas: ODEs, PDEs, probabilistic and statistical numerical methods including monte carlo, random walks etc., inverse problems, fluid dynamics, mathematical modeling in epidemiology, population dynamics, traffic flow etc., machine learning and, in general, in computational and applied mathematics areas. If it seems difficult or intimidating, it is not once you discuss it with me. You will be carefully mentored to do research and in the process get paid. You can also register for math 491 for zero credit. If you are interested, please email me asap a short resume or even better talk to me. If you are hired, you will be a TAMU employee and there are some procedures including background checks done by human resources. Since everything slows down during the upcoming holidays, to get hired and get paid during Spring, you should definitely talk to me or express an interest to me asap. The pay is $10/hour.

You can walk in anytime in my office Blocker 629D but it is better to make an appointment if you can. Thank you.
